# Website

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/qAIRa/qAIRa.github.io.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/qAIRa/qAIRa.github.io)

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Installation

```sh
yarn
```

## Local Development

```sh
yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and open up a browser window.
Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```sh
yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

```sh
GIT_USER=<Your GitHub username> USE_SSH=true yarn deploy
```

If you are using GitHub pages for hosting, this command is a convenient way to build the website and push to the `gh-pages` branch.
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

```sh
npm start
  Starts the development server.

npm run build
  Bundles the app into static files for production.

npm deploy
  Publish website to GitHub pages.
```

We suggest that you begin by typing:

```sh
cd Documentation-OpenSource
npm start
```
